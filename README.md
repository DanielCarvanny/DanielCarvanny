👋 Hi there!
I’m a Bachelor of Information Systems student, currently in my first semester at CEFET.

🌱 I have foundational knowledge in programming languages like Java, NodeJS, HTML, TypeScript, and Handlebars. I’m also starting to explore Dockerfiles and SQL.

💻 I recently developed a simple CRUD microservice using Java, and I'm eager to take on new challenges to deepen my understanding.

📊 I have some introductory experience with databases such as MySQL and MongoDB, and I’m getting familiar with IDEs like IntelliJ and VSCode.

🔍 I am curious and motivated, always looking for opportunities to learn more about technology and software development practices.

🌍 I believe in the value of collaboration and am open to contributing to projects, even as I continue to grow my skills.

📫 Feel free to reach out or check out my repositories!
